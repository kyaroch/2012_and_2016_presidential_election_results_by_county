## Purpose of this repository

Recently I was looking for county-by-county results of the 2012 presidential
election, but was unable to find this data freely available in a usable format.
Although the data is available for free in several places on the Internet, it's
generally not provided in a consistent format, and cannot be used for mapping
or data analysis without a lot of tedious cleanup. Obtaining the data in a
consistent tabular format requires payment or institutional access.

Since others are presumably interested in this data as well, I decided to clean
up the 2012 data, along with the 2016 data as it is published, and make it
publicly available.

## Contents of this repository

The original basis for this dataset is the [2012 election results table](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/07/us-2012-election-county-results-download) provided by the *Guardian*. I reformatted the table so that every
row uses the same column order. Since the table provides FIPS codes, you can
load this spreadsheet into a GIS application and join it to county shapefiles
right away.

I've also been adding official results for the 2016 presidential election as
they become available. It always takes weeks after the election for counting to
be completed, and sometimes this leads people to draw erroneous conclusions â€“
you may remember, for example, that much of the commentary immediately after the
2016 election was premised on a large drop in turnout, which, as we now know,
did not happen. For this reason, I won't be adding states to this table until
they certify their results.

Certified results for the following states (plus DC)
have been compiled: AL, AR, AZ, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, HI, KS, KY, LA, MI, MN, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, OH, OK, OR, RI, SC, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WI, WY

Results for the following states have been certified, but have not been compiled: AK, MA

The `maps` directory contains some SVG maps created in QGIS, which I will also
update.

## Limitations of this data

* Vote totals for individual third-party and independent candidates are not
listed. Since each state had different third-party candidates on the ballot,
and tabulated the results differently, tracking them individually would have
taken additional time that I chose not to invest. However, the vote totals do
include all candidates.
* I had to enter some of this information manually or using ad hoc scripts.. I
ran some basic sanity checks and corrected the errors I found, but I can't
guarantee that the data is completely free of mistakes.
* The *Guardian* data does not list individual boroughs in Alaska. Alaska
officially reports vote totals by state house district, not borough. I do not
yet know where to find vote totals by borough.

## Todo

* I'd like to add the voting-eligible population for both 2012 and 2016, in
order to calculate turnout and changes in turnout. I don't know where to
obtain this information for individual counties. If you do, please let me know.

## Miscellaneous notes
* These FIPS codes are formatted without leading zeroes. US Census Department
shapefiles do use leading zeroes. Watch out for this when making maps.
* At least two counties changed in some way between 2012 and 2016. Shannon
County, SD changed its name to Oglala Lakota County in 2015, and its FIPS code
also changed. Bedford City, VA gave up its independent city status in 2013 and
became part of Bedford County. You may need to fix these manually if you're
using data from 2012.
* 2016 Nevada vote totals do not include "none of these candidates." I have not
yet checked to see whether the 2012 totals include these votes.
* 2016 NH totals do not include write-ins, as these have not been reported yet,
although the numbers are probably negligible anyway.
* Results for New England are officially reported by town, not county. I had to
manually enter county-by-county information for some of these states.

data using [Dave Leip's election atlas](http://uselectionatlas.org/).
